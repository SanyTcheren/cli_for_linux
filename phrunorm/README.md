# Normalize Phone Number 
Change the phone number to a pattern: **+N NNN NNN-NN-NN**
## Motivation
Normalize the phone number as follows:
- replace 8 with +7
- remove inappropriate parentheses
- arrange `-` and spaces correctly 
## Usage
Run the utility in a terminal:
```bash
$ phrunorm.py
```
Now copy the phone number to the system clipboard,
 after that you can paste the normalized phone number
 into the text from the system clipboard.

To stop the utility, use `Ctrl-C`in the terminal
